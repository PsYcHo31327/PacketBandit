# PacketBandit# Packet Capture

## Description

### What?
We will create a packet capturing program, used to record and ananlyze packet information in a easy readable format for users by implementing a confomrtable Graphic user interface.

### Why?
Companies tend to utilize networks for nearly everything, from storing data about current projects to running work computers. Some companies do not fully understand how much information they handle in a day. There are many tools that have been created to abuse a companiesâ€™ network security, and we are creating an easy way to browse and filter this information.


### How?
Packet Bandit is an application that is going to record the clients packet information and apply a network filter. Once recorded the user can navigate there packets with the supplied GUI

### Deliverables
1. Presentation
* Powerpoint of our project as a reference to our project. Detail some of our developement and an overview of packets.

2. Packet Bandit Demo
* Includes GUI, Packet Info, Packet Capture Process
* Will try to include capture of multiple type requests (SMTP, HTTP, UDP).

### Plan
- Stage 1: Research types of packet capture, how it is used and why companies need to record packets.
- Stage 2: Learn more about the coding implementations of socket API in Java.
- Stage 3: Set up the router on one of our laptops.
- Stage 4: Write the code to be able to capture packets from a network. The application will attempt packet capture and recording. Then we will spend the remaining time Debugging.
- Stage 5: Creating and preparing the presentation.
